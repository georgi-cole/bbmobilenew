    story: `Finn grew up on the rugged coast of Finland, where the sea was both playground and teacher. As a child, he watched massive cargo ships glide through the harbor and dreamed of designing vessels that could brave any storm. After years of rigorous study and countless sleepless nights, he became one of Europe's most sought-after marine architects. But success came at a cost—his marriage crumbled under the weight of his ambition, and his teenage daughter barely speaks to him anymore. Now, standing at a crossroads in his life, Finn sees Big Brother as a chance to prove he's more than just blueprints and calculations. He's here to show the world—and himself—that he can navigate the unpredictable waters of human connection with the same skill he brings to designing ships. Will his analytical mind be his greatest asset or his downfall in the ultimate social experiment?`,

But freedom came with a price—she's barely scraping by, performing for tips and living in a cramped apartment with three roommates. Her dream of recording an album feels impossibly far away. When the opportunity to enter Big Brother presented itself, Mimi saw it as her ticket to exposure and the prize money that could change everything. Sweet and seemingly naive, she hides a fierce competitive streak beneath her gentle exterior. In a house full of strangers, will her music be her salvation or will the pressure break her into a thousand discordant notes?`,

Through scholarships and sheer determination, she earned her MBA and transformed herself into a powerhouse executive. But behind the polished suits and commanding presence lies a woman haunted by the choices she's made—relationships sacrificed, friendships abandoned, family disappointed by her constant absence. Her black belt in karate isn't just for fitness; it's a reminder that she knows how to fight. In Big Brother, Rae sees a strategic battlefield where she can apply her corporate warfare tactics.

But behind the glamorous facade is a young woman drowning in imposter syndrome and crushing student debt. Born to immigrant parents who sacrificed everything for her education, Nova feels the weight of their expectations crushing her daily. She writes sci-fi stories late at night, tales of alternate realities where she's brave enough to chase her real dreams instead of playing it safe. Her apartment walls are covered with rejection letters from publishers and film studios, each one a reminder that creativity alone isn't enough in Hollywood. Big Brother represents something terrifying and exhilarating: a chance to step into the spotlight and prove she's more than someone else's assistant. But when the cameras are always rolling, can she hide the cracks in her carefully constructed persona?`,

Yet his own life feels strangely hollow—relationships fail because he approaches them like optimization problems, friendships fade because he's always working, and his family wonders what happened to the curious boy who used to ask endless questions about everything. His polyglot abilities came from years of forcing himself to connect across cultures, but somewhere along the way, he lost the ability to connect with himself. Big Brother is his radical experiment: can someone who spends all day analyzing patterns in artificial intelligence learn to understand the unpredictable nature of human emotion? In a house full of strangers, his greatest challenge won't be competitions or strategy—it will be learning to be vulnerable.`,

His romantic relationships have failed because partners feel like they're dating a computer rather than a person. His friends have learned to tolerate his blunt observations, though they've stopped inviting him to parties. Big Brother represents the ultimate puzzle: a game where the pieces are people and the rules are constantly shifting. Zed believes he can strategize his way to victory, but he's about to discover that human emotions don't follow logical patterns.

But no puzzle has prepared her for the mystery of why she feels so disconnected from everyone around her. She watches others form easy friendships and wonders what social algorithm she's missing. Her PhD was supposed to give her answers, but instead it gave her more questions. Big Brother is her most dangerous experiment yet: putting herself under the microscope instead of observing others.

But his own anxiety disorder is a secret he guards fiercely, masked by morning meditation and carefully maintained calm. The irony isn't lost on him—he's most at peace when he's most alone. His ex-girlfriend called him emotionally unavailable; his parents worry he's wasting his potential hiding in the bush. Big Brother is either the worst decision he's ever made or the bravest.

Paris fashion week is bittersweet; she still loves the artistry but hates the artifice. Her bisexuality was weaponized by tabloids during her modeling days, every relationship scrutinized and sensationalized. She learned to deflect with elegance, turning pain into poise. But beneath the sophisticated exterior is a 24-year-old still healing from being chewed up and spit out by an industry she once worshipped. Big Brother offers a strange kind of freedom—a chance to be watched on her own terms, to control her narrative instead of letting others write it.

His name came from his mother, a former jazz singer who died when he was twelve, leaving him with nothing but a nickname and a tendency to observe life rather than live it. His journals are filled with detailed accounts of parties he attended but didn't enjoy, relationships he analyzed but didn't feel, moments he recorded but didn't experience. His therapist calls it avoidance; Blue calls it processing. Big Brother is his strangest entry yet—a game where observation is survival, where quiet watching might actually be an asset. But in a house designed to force interaction, will the observer finally step out of the margins and into his own story? Or will he leave with just another journal full of everyone else's moments?`,

Every sunrise workout, every punishing training session, every competition is war against his former self. But the war never ends. Despite his transformed physique and successful coaching business, he still sees the fat kid in the mirror. His relationships fail because partners grow tired of competing with his obsession. His family worries that he's replaced one extreme with another.

Her mantra "stay cheerful" has become a prison sentence. Big Brother is her longest run yet: 24/7 in a house with no escape route, no finish line to cross. When you can't outrun your emotions anymore, when the mask of cheerfulness starts to crack, what's underneath? Bea is about to find out.`,

    story: `Nico Ferreira makes things disappear—coins, cards, occasionally his responsibilities. As an Illusion Entertainer in Lisbon's tourist districts, he performs sleight-of-hand magic for crowds while avoiding anything that feels too real. His weekend magic shows pay just enough to fund his playful pranks and avoid commitment to anything serious. Friends find him charming; his family finds him frustrating; his ex-girlfriends find him exhausting. He's 28 going on 18, and everyone's starting to notice. His pranks are getting desperate—switching his brother's sugar with salt, hiding his roommate's keys, photoshopping fake screenshots to spark drama. The line between playful and problematic has blurred, but Nico won't acknowledge it. Big Brother is either his ultimate stage or his reckoning. In a house where pranks have consequences and charm has limits, can the magician finally grow up? Or will he try to prank his way out of every serious situation until there's nothing left to disappear into?`,

    story: `Kian Rossi walks through Milan's streets seeing not what is, but what could be. As an Urban Planner, he dreams of transforming concrete jungles into vibrant, sustainable communities where people thrive. Raised in a working-class neighborhood that was gentrified out of existence, Kian's passion for inclusive urban design is personal. He fights daily battles with developers who see only profit margins, not communities. His idealism has cost him promotions and made him enemies in city hall, but he refuses to compromise his vision. Big Brother is his chance to prove that collaboration and strategic thinking can build something better than cutthroat competition ever could. In a game about alliances and territory, the urban planner will try to design a path to victory that leaves no one behind.`,
